              Hello 👋, I'm Jasmeher Singh, and I'm stoked to have you here. I'm
              a Full-Stack Web Developer 💻 with more than 1 year of experience
              in the MERN stack, as well as a budding 3D artist and developer. I
              have a strong passion 🔥 for web development and creating
              immersive and engaging digital experiences that meet the needs of
              both clients and end-users.

            <h3 class="section-heading">Technical Skills</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              I've got some serious technical skills under my belt. As a full
              stack web developer, I'm comfortable with the MERN stack and love
              building out robust, scalable web applications. I'm always on the
              lookout for new technologies to dive into, and lately, I've been
              teaching myself Blender and Three.js. TypeScript is also on my
              radar, and I'm excited to add it to my toolkit soon.
              <br />
              Here are some other technologies and tools I'm proficient in:

            </ul>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Teamwork</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              As a team player, I value open communication, collaboration, and
              feedback. I thrive in a fast-paced environment and enjoy taking on
              new challenges and solving complex problems.

              developments in the field, and I am committed to delivering
              high-quality work that exceeds expectations.
              <br />
              If you're looking for a skilled and dedicated full-stack web

            <p class="section-text">
              One of my notable projects is an e-commerce website built using
              the MERN stack. This project was created to practice my skills in
              building full-stack applications. The website focuses on techwear
              clothing and allows users to create accounts, browse items, add
              them to their cart, and checkout using stripe. The website also
              keeps track of user purchases and displays them in their order
              history. It's pretty dope if I do say so myself. 😎

              Another project that I worked on was a social media app built
              using React and Material UI. The app features both a light and
              dark mode, and allows users to create accounts, create posts, and
              like other user's posts. This project was created to practice
              implementing Material UI components and theming.<br />
              Definitely give it a try! 📱

            <p class="section-text">
              The third project I worked on was a portfolio website featuring a
              3D model of my room. The website was built using Three.js and
              showcases my skills in 3D modeling and development. The website
              allows users to view the 3D model of my room and view my
              portfolio.

              Outside of work, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me
              physically and mentally engaged.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Powerlifting</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              When I'm not coding up a storm, you can find me in the gym,
              powerlifting, which allows me to challenge myself physically and
              set goals for personal improvement. I love the feeling of pushing
              my limits and seeing my progress over time. It's also a great way
              to relieve stress and clear my mind.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Playing Football</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              I also enjoy playing football, specifically as a right back. It
              provides me with an opportunity to socialize and work on my
              teamwork and coordination skills, while also allowing me to use my
              speed, agility and power to defend against opponents. It's a great
              way to stay active and have fun at the same time.
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Watching Movies/TV Shows</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              In addition to sports, I also enjoy spending time indoors,
              watching movies and TV shows. It's my guilty pleasure and the
              perfect way to unwind after a long day of coding. Plus, I love
              discussing my favorite movies and shows with my friends, so feel
              free to hit me up if you want to talk about the latest Anime,
              movie or debate whether One Piece or Naruto is the better
              anime.(It's One Piece!)
            </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Playing Video Games</h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              I also enjoy playing video games, which provides me with a fun and
              engaging way to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in
              technology and user experience design. It's a great way to unwind
              and have fun, while also challenging my problem-solving skills and
              creativity.

            <h3 class="section-heading">
              Learning New Technologies and Skills
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
              Finally, I enjoy learning new technologies and skills, whether
              it's through online courses or experimenting with new programming
              languages and tools. I believe that continuous learning is key to
              personal and professional growth, and I'm always looking for new
              ways to challenge myself and expand my knowledge.
